# Thoughts #

Some initial thoughts:

  * Avails + Queries (e.g. if I need X+Y+Z, how many impressions can I get?)
    * Sitelists
    * Geo Area
    * IAB Contextual categories
    * Publisher properties?
    * Audience/Cookie-Match pools (also by segment?)
  * Pre-Filtering (view, change)
  * Contact info?
