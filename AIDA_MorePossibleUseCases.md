# Place to collect information about possible use-cases

There's a bunch of questions that we usually have
  * Who's the publisher?
  * Whats the URL?
  * Is there any additional inventory hierarchy we can see?
  * Is this available through other exchanges / SSP's.
  * If so, how is the inventory divided between them?
  * How much volume do they have?
  * Is there a minimum CPM?
  * What are the main concerns a DSP has when targeting this inventory?

Mostly just around the above.  We're concerned when we buy inventory from two places and see that sometimes its exactly the same.
  * We don't want to double bid and raise prices.
  * We would like to know if the price is higher on one exchange, if its because its premium inventory or just being marked up.
